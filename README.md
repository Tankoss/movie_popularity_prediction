This file was created to complete the final assignment of the Linear Regression and Modeling course at Coursera. The main goal of the assignment is to find out what makes movies popular.

The results of the analysis are wrapped into report which consists of 7 parts, such as:

## The Purpose of the Analysis
This section addresses the main goal of the analysis.

## Data Understanding
This part introduces the data set, variables and illustrates the method in which data was obtained.

## Data Exploration
This chapter includes:
<ul>
<li> main visualizations (scatter plots, bar plots, box plots)
<li> descriptive statistic summaries on each variable
<li> data transformation and introducing new variables
</ul>

## Modeling
This chapter describes the modeling process, selection method, and criteria that were used to choose the true model.

## Model Diagnostic
This section includes plots and explanations on conditions to consider fitted MLR model valid:
<ul>
<li>linearity
<li>normality
<li>constant variability
<li>independent residuals
</ul>

## Outliers
Here presented information on identifying extreme points, their treatment methods, and model re-fitting.

## Prediction
In this section, the final model was tested by predicting the rating of the movie not included in the data set.

## Conclusion
A brief summary of the findings from the previous sections as well as a discussion of what was learned about the data and research question. This section also discusses shortcomings of  the study (either due to data collection or methodology) and includes ideas for possible future research.
